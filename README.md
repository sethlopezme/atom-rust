# atom-rust

Provide Rust language support in Atom.

This Atom package is still under development. It has barebones functionality
right now, but I hope to expand that functionality over time. I am open to
suggestions and contributors!

## Setup

- [Install the Rust Language Server](https://github.com/rust-lang-nursery/rls#setup)
- Install the following Atom packages:
  - [linter](https://atom.io/packages/linter)
  - [hyperclick](https://atom.io/packages/hyperclick)
